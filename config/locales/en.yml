      more_html: <p>The Taube IMT collection is part of the <a href="https://humanrights.stanford.edu">Stanford Center for Human Rights and International Justice</a>'s <a href="https://humanrights.stanford.edu/digital-archives-and-new-technologies/virtual-tribunals-initiative-wwii-trial-records-collections">Virtual Tribunal initiative</a>. This project makes a significant contribution to the international communityâ€™s cooperative efforts to ensure the long-term preservation of Virtual Tribunal archives. We anticipate continuing to grow this site with additional post-WWII collections from the U.S. Military War Crimes Trials in Europe and in the Far East. Beyond that, other forthcoming collections from more recent international criminal tribunals will include video and audio recordings of court proceedings, alongside transcripts, and evidence presented at trial.</p>
