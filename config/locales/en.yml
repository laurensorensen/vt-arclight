      more_html: <p>The Taube IMT collection is part of the <a href="https://humanrights.stanford.edu">Stanford Center for Human Rights and International Justice</a>'s <a href="https://humanrights.stanford.edu/digital-archives-and-new-technologies/virtual-tribunals-initiative-wwii-trial-records-collections">Virtual Tribunal initiative</a>. This project makes a significant contribution to the international community’s cooperative efforts to ensure the long-term preservation of Virtual Tribunal archives. We anticipate continuing to grow this site with additional post-WWII collections from the U.S. Military War Crimes Trials in Europe and in the Far East. Beyond that, other forthcoming collections from more recent international criminal tribunals will include video and audio recordings of court proceedings, alongside transcripts, and evidence presented at trial.</p>

      exhibit_description_html: <p> The <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/virtual-tribunals">Virtual Tribunals online exhibits site</a> is a major initiative intended to compile a comprehensive database of international criminal tribunal records and rendered searchable through a single online portal. </p> <p> The first collection exhibit made available here consisted of court records from the <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/virtual-tribunals/catalog?f%5Bcollection_with_title%5D%5B%5D=kh392jb5994-%7C-Trial+Records+of+the+Special+Panels+for+Serious+Crimes+%28SPSC%29+in+East+Timor">Special Panel for Serious Crimes in East Timor</a>. More recently we added records from the <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/virtual-tribunals/catalog?f%5Bcollection_with_title%5D%5B%5D=mt839rq8746-%7C-International+Court+of+Justice+Archives+of+the+Nuremberg+International+Military+Tribunal">Taube IMT archival collection</a>.

      intro_html: <p>Virtual Tribunals is a collaboration between Stanford’s <a href="https://humanrights.stanford.edu">Center for Human Rights and International Justice</a> and <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/">Stanford University Libraries (SUL)</a>. The objective is to facilitate free access to a comprehensive database of archival material from the tribunals and truth commissions around the globe, on a platform that makes discovery of materials far easier and more efficient than is currently the case for both legally trained users and lay-audiences, including populations directly affected by conflict or living in relevant diaspora communities. </p>
