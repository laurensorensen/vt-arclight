In the very beginning of the Nazi Party and itsconspiracy , defendant Frick misused his various governmental positions in order to hold a "protecting hand over the National-Socialist Party and Hitler”. 3119-PS: Frick’s speech before the Munich People’s Court during the Putsch trial; in:"Dr. Frick und sein Minis- terium"(Dr. Wilhelm Frick and his Ministry)(Central Publishing House of the NSDAP, 1937) page 195. 3124-PS: Rudolf Hess: "Redlen" (Speeches) (Central Publishing House of the NSDAP, 1940) pages 216-17; Frick secures Hitler's release from jail after the letter's arrest for illegal political activities. 3125-F5; Adolf Hitler: Mein Kampf, page 403 (■4Ho» Ed.

Here again defendant Frick misused his official authority in order to advance the Nazi conspiracy through measures designed to establish Nazi control over the police, and over the adnini stration and curriculum of universities and schools.

(d) during his tenure in Thuringia, defendant Frick went even further in the misuse of his official powers on behalf of the Conspiracy. He attempted to secure to adolf Hitler German citizenship rights by means of e fraudulent natural ization procedure. Having authority as State Minister of the Interior to appoint civil servants, defeniant Frick prepared to give such an appointment to the then stateless Alolf Hitler, it being understood that Hitler would not be expected to perform the functions of the office to which he was to be appointed. Under the German Citizenship Law of 1913, which was then in force, such en appointment would have automatically conferred German citizenship on Hitler. Only the premature discovery of this intended fraud pre vented defendent Frick fj c: succeeding in his maneuvers. 3399 _S: Affidavit of Robert M.".

In the full use of these broad powers, defendant Frick made his essential contribution to the advancement of the Conspiracy. His first act after the Conspirator s’ accession to power was to in stall Nazi governments and adninistrationin all German States where they were not already in power. Tho" Steic Governments which refused to hand over their constitutional authority to the Nazi successors designated by Frick were removed on Frick's order.

In further preparation for the aggressive wars planned by the conspirators, defendant Frick used his power, prestige, and funds as Minister of the Interior in order to command support for the organization of a Fifth Column abroad among foreign nationals of German ancestry. In a circular of 24 February 1933 issued less than a month after the Conspirators had taken over the government of Germany, the defendant ordered all State Governments to support, especially financially, the organization work of the League for Germandom Abroad among the "30 million Germans in foreign countries (Auslandsdeutschen) outside of the present contracted borders of the Reich /who/ are an integral part of the entire German people". 3258-PS: "HTationnl-Socialism" , (U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, 1943) p. 446-448 (original German text: p. 444-445).

In his speech at the twentieth annual meeting of the official German Foreign Institute held in Stuttgart, on 11-15 August 1937, defendant Frick stated that "the new Germany has recognized that its attention and devotion to the welfare of the millions of Germans who have not the fortune to owe political allegiance to Germany, but who are condemned to live abroad, are not merely a matter of natural sympathy and solidarity, but are in a higher degree dictated ^X-Ahe__strong, political and economic interests of the Reich" (emphasis supplied). - 20 -1240-0042 - 21 - 3258-FS: "National-Socialism" (U.S. Gove rnme nt Printi ng Office, Washington, 1943) p. 128-129.

His authority was clearly defined in a Secret Decree issued on 29 August 1943. That Decree provided. that the Keich Protector t was "the representative of the Fuehrer in his capacity as Chief of State." In addition to this over-all authority defendant Frick was eiven jurisdiction "to confirm the members of the government of the - rotectorate , to appoint, dismiss and retire the German civil servants in the Protectorate." He was given full power "to grant pardons and to quash proceedings in all cases except in cases before the Military and SS Police Courts." 1366-PS: Secret Decree of 29 August 1943, on the position, duties and authorities of the Keich Protector in Bohemia and Moravia, in: Budget of the Keich Pro tectorate for 1944; introduction. These broad powers establish the clear responsibility of de ¬ fendant jrick for the crimes committed in the Protectorate under his administration during the last 20 months of the War. As repre sentative of the Fuehrer in the Protectorate, he covered these criminal acts with Hitler's name and absolute power. Above all, defendant Frick is fully responsible for the multiple miscarriages of Justice by which the population of the Protectorate was systematically persecuted and oppressed. His failure to correctH1240 -00 - 25 - these miscarriages of justice through the exercise of his right to grant pardons and to quash legal proceedings is tantamount to a confirmation of the cruel and illegal sentences imposed upon the inhabitants of the Protectorate. The defendant’s specific responsibility on these counts must be added to the over-all responsibility which he bears because of the mere fact that he was Reich Protector, while such crimes were committed against the population of Bohemia and Moravia. 3443-PS: Supplement No. 5 to the official Czechoslovak Report containing an official memorandum on the activities of defendant Wilhelm Prick.H1240 - 004 - 26 - VII.

Misusing his governmental positions in the pre-Hitler era, he gave aiA and protection to the conspirators when they were still weak. He supported them in their first attempt to come into power by force, expecting to gain high office from their success. He was the first to carry their revolutionary program from the Beer Hall to the Reichstag Rostrum, as their earliest - important office -holder (in Thuringia), he developed for the first time their totalitarian and ter roristic methods of political and intellectual control. Upon the accession to power of the Nazi conspirators on 30 January 1933, Frick took over the vital Ministry of Interior. From this position he directed the realization of ths entire domestic program of the con spiracy. He took complete charge of the successive destruction of the parliamentary system, of autonomous State and local government, and of the career civil service. He planned and executed the measures which subjected the government itself to the domination of the Nazi Party. He then proceeded to establish a huge Reich Police Force under Himmler which became the instrument with which the Nazi conspirators terrorized and ultimately "liquidated” all opposition inside and outside Germany in concentration and extermination camps. In order to give the semblance of law to the criminal acts of the conspirators, defendant Frick drafted legislation to withdraw con stitutional protection from the rights and liberties which they had determined to wipe out. He participated in the relentless and violent persecution of all persons and eroups who were considered as actual or potential oponents of the conspirators' plans. Among these were the churches, the'free trade unions, and especially the Jews. Having -Se cured absolute contro, over Germany for the conspirators. Defendant Frick proceeded to bring the German people and State into readiness for the Wars of Aggression, planned by the conspirators. He established the system of military and labor service on which theH1240-0050 - 29 - Wehrmacht was to rest. He took over the planning of Germany’s civilian wartime administration, which was to back it up. 4s the Nazi conspirators b- gen to achieve their predatory aims, Defendant Frick was active in the coordination of the administration of the territories and peoples which fell into Nazi hands. He presided ver the annexation of territories and the denationalization of their inhabitants in violation of the Hague Conventions. When the conspirators were ready to proceed to the realization of their ultimate goals, es pecially the complete enslavement and annihilation of conquered popula tions, defendant Frick devised the basic legislation for their disfran chisement and finally took personal charge of one of the oppressed nations, Czechoslovakia, Thus, the defendant was one of the principal artisans of the con spiracy in all its thoroughness and viciousness. Eis contribution to _ts progress was essential in all of its phases, decisive in many. He nurtured the conspiracy, directed its followers, terrorized its opponents, and destroyed its victims.
